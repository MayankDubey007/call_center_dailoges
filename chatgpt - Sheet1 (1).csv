"109","And as for the data overage, it seems like your plan has a certain limit on data usage and you exceeded that limit during your trip."
"110","Aur data overage ke baare mein, lagta hai ki aapke plan mein data usage par ek limit hai aur aapne apne trip ke dauran us limit ko exceed kiya."
"111","That can definitely happen when we're out and about using GPS, streaming, and so on."
"112","Yeh definitely ho sakta hai jab hum bahar hote hain aur GPS, streaming, etc. ka use karte hain."

"124","Kripya dhyaan dein ki dependents ko sirf annual enrollment period mein ya qualifying life event ke dauran hi plan se hataaya ja sakta hai, jaise divorce hona ya dependent ka 26 saal ka ho jaana."
"125","I can imagine your frustration, sir."
"126","Main aapki frustration samajh sakta hoon, sir."
"127","It must be exhausting to keep calling and not get the answers you need."
"128","Yeh thoda thakane wala hoga ki baar-baar call kar rahe ho aur aapko jawab nahi mil rahe hain."

"139","I completely understand this isn't the news you wanted to hear, especially with how it's impacting your package."

"141","I do apologize for the inconvenience."
"142","Main aapko is asuvidha ke liye maafi chahta hoon."
"143","Ham aapako prakriya shuroo hone se pahale hee usake lie anumaanit laagat bata sakate hain."
"144","Hum aapko process shuru hone se pehle hi uske liye estimated cost bata sakte hain."
"145","Lekin aapako apane dekhabhaal pradaata ke saath vaastavik laagat kee pushti karanee hogee."
"146","Lekin aapko apne care provider ke saath actual cost ki confirmation karni hogi."
"147","Aap hamaaree vebasait par apane khaate mein log in karake aur sanketon ka paalan karake ya hamaaree graahak seva lain par kol karake laagat anumaan ka anurodh kar sakate hain."
"148","Aap hamari website par apne account mein login karke aur instructions follow karke ya hamare customer service line par call karke cost estimate request kar sakte hain."
"149","Agrim mein laagat anumaan praapt karana ek achchha vichaar hai taaki aapako apanee vitteey jimmedaariyon kee behatar samajh ho sake."
"150","Advance mein cost estimate lena ek achha idea hai taaki aap apni financial responsibilities ko better samajh sakein."
"151","I totally get it sir, and I truly appreciate your patience throughout all of this."
"152","Main bilkul samajhta hoon, sir, aur main aapke patience ko sach mein sarahata hoon is sab ke dauran."
"153","It's never easy dealing with something like this, especially when it feels like there's no clear solution."
"154","Aise cheezon ko handle karna kabhi aasan nahi hota, khaas kar jab lagta hai ki koi clear solution nahi hai."
"155","But I'm confident the replacement will solve the problem."
"156","Lekin mujhe pura vishwas hai ki replacement problem solve kar dega."
"157","And just to reassure you, I'll keep an eye on the order and follow up to make sure everything goes smoothly from here."

"170","Tab tak, agar hum koi bhi madad kar sakte hain situation ko thoda asaan banane ke liye, jaise additional support ya suggestions dena, toh main madad karne ke liye tayaar hoon."
"171","Sure, I would be glad to."
"172","Bilkul, main khushi se bataunga."
"173","Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period of time, usually 10, 20, or 30 years."
"174","Term life insurance ek specific time period ke liye coverage deta hai, aam taur par 10, 20, ya 30 saal ke liye."
"175","It is the most affordable type of life insurance, but it does not build cash value."
"176","Yeh life insurance ka sabse sasta type hai, lekin isse cash value nahi banti."
"177","Whole life insurance, on the other hand, provides lifelong coverage and also builds cash value over time."
"178","Whole life insurance, dusri taraf, lifelong coverage deta hai aur waqt ke saath cash value bhi banata hai."
"179","Which you can borrow against or withdraw."

"183","I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused, Mr. Ferguson."
"184","Main is asuvidha ke liye maafi chahta hoon jo aapko hui hai, Mr. Ferguson."
"185","I understand how critical it is to have a functioning air conditioner in this heat, especially with children in the house."
"186","Main samajhta hoon ki is garmi mein, khaas kar jab ghar mein bachche ho, ek kaam karta hua air conditioner hona kitna zaroori hai."
"187","Let me review your account and see if there's anything we can do to expedite this."
"188","Mujhe aapka account dekhne dijiye aur dekhte hain agar hum is process ko jaldi karne ke liye kuch kar sakte hain."
"189","Please hold for a moment."
"190","Kripya thodi der ke liye rukiye."
"191","I see the issue here; unfortunately, our remote diagnostics have not resolved the problem."
"192","Mujhe yahan problem dikhayi de rahi hai; afsos, hamare remote diagnostics se problem solve nahi ho paayi."
"193","And the next step is to have a technician visit and fix the unit."
"194","Aur agla step yeh hoga ki ek technician ko bheja jaye jo unit ko thik kare"
"195","I completely understand, sir."
"196","Main bilkul samajhta hoon, sir."
"197","I can't imagine how uncomfortable it must be right now, and I'm really sorry for all the trouble you've had."
"198","Main nahi soch sakta ki abhi aapko kitna asuvidha ho raha hoga, aur main aapke sabhi takleefon ke liye sach mein maafi chahta hoon."
"199","I'll do everything I can to make sure this replacement resolves the issue once it arrives."
"200","Main jo kuch bhi kar sakta hoon, wo karunga taaki yeh replacement jab aayega, to problem solve ho jaye."
"201","If you need any help setting it up, please feel free to reach out, and I'll be more than happy to walk you through the process."
"202","Agar aapko setup karne mein koi madad chahiye, toh bina jhijak hamse contact karein, main khushi se aapko process samjha dunga."

"206","Main bilkul samajhta hoon ki yeh delay aapko apne customer ke saath mushkil mein daal raha hai."
"207","And I'm really sorry it's caused you so much stress."
"208","Aur main sach mein maafi chahta hoon ki isse aapko itna stress hua hai."
"209","While I can't change the weather, what I can do is make sure your package gets the priority it needs."
"210","Jabki main mausam nahi badal sakta, jo main kar sakta hoon wo yeh hai ki main ensure karunga ki aapka package ko zaroori priority mile."
"211","Now that it's back in transit, I'll also personally follow up with you tomorrow to make sure it's arrived on time."
"212","Ab jab yeh dubara transit mein hai, main kal personally aapke saath follow up karunga taaki yeh ensure ho sake ki package time par pohonch gaya ho."
"213","So you won't have to worry about chasing down updates."
"214","Isliye aapko updates ke liye bhaag-daud karne ki chinta nahi karni padegi."
"215","I completely understand."
"216","Main bilkul samajhta hoon."
"217","I know it must be very challenging when you're the one facing your customer's frustration."
"218","Mujhe pata hai ki jab aapko apne customer ki frustration ka samna karna padta hai, toh wo kaafi challenging hota hai."
"219","But on the bright side, at least you have a concrete update to share with them now."
"220","Lekin achhi baat yeh hai ki ab aapke paas unhe dene ke liye ek solid update hai."
"221","And you can let them know it's arriving tomorrow."
"222","Aur aap unhe bata sakte hain ki yeh kal aa raha hai."
"223","Plus, I'll be here to follow up and make sure everything's on track."
"224","Iske alawa, main yahaan hoon follow up karne ke liye aur ensure karne ke liye ki sab kuch sahi chal raha hai."
"225","It sounds like you've been handling this situation really well, given how much is out of your control."
"226","Yeh lagta hai ki aap is situation ko kaafi acchi tarah handle kar rahe ho, jabki jitna kuch aapke control mein nahi tha."
"227","After you submit the appeal, our claims department will review your case."
"228","Jab aap appeal submit karenge, hamara claims department aapke case ko review karega."
"229","And determine whether the charges are covered under your plan."
"230","Aur yeh decide karega ki charges aapke plan ke under covered hain ya nahi."
"231","We'll notify you of the decision in writing."
"232","Hum aapko decision likhit roop mein notify karenge."
"233","If the appeal is successful and the charges are covered, you'll receive an adjusted medical invoice that will show your refund amount."
"234","Agar appeal successful hoti hai aur charges covered hote hain, toh aapko ek adjusted medical invoice milega jisme aapka refund amount dikhai dega."
"235","If the appeal is denied, you'll receive a letter explaining the reasons for the decision."
"236","Agar appeal deny ho jati hai, toh aapko ek letter milega jo decision ke reasons ko explain karega."
"237","I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Davis, given the situation."
"238","Main aapki frustration ko bilkul samajhta hoon, Mr. Davis, is situation ko dekhte hue."
"239","And based on your warranty coverage, I'd recommend we send you a replacement thermostat at no cost."
"240","Aur aapke warranty coverage ke adhar par, main recommend karunga ki hum aapko ek replacement thermostat bina kisi cost ke bhejein."
"241","We'll take care of the shipping and everything."
"242","Hum shipping aur sab kuch handle karenge."
"243","And you'll get a prepaid return label to send the current one back once the new unit arrives."
"244","Aur aapko ek prepaid return label milega taaki aap current unit ko wapas bhej sakein, jaise hi naya unit arrive hota hai."
"245","I know this doesn't help you immediately, but does that sound like a good solution for you?"
"246","Mujhe pata hai ki yeh turant aapki madad nahi karega, lekin kya yeh aapke liye ek achha solution lagta hai?"
"247","I understand, Mr. Garfield."
"248","Main samajhta hoon, Mr. Garfield."
"249","Let me take a look at the notifications we sent to you."
"250","Main aapko bheje gaye notifications ko dekh leta hoon."
"251","I see here that a payment reminder was emailed to you a few days before the due date."
"252","Mujhe yeh dikhai de raha hai ki due date se kuch din pehle aapko ek payment reminder email kiya gaya tha."
"253","But sometimes those can end up in Spam folders or get missed."
"254","Lekin kabhi-kabhi yeh spam folders mein chala jata hai ya miss ho jata hai."
"255","What I can do for you is set up a text alert for future bills."
"256","Jo main aapke liye kar sakta hoon woh yeh hai ki aapke future bills ke liye ek text alert set kar doon."
"257","That way you'll get a direct notification on your phone as well as an email."
"258","Is tareeke se aapko direct notification aapke phone par milega, saath hi email bhi."
"259","Would that be helpful?"
"260","Kya yeh madadgar hoga?"
"261","I'm so glad I could explain it in more detail for you."
"262","Main bahut khush hoon ki main aapko zyada detail mein samjha paaya."
"263","And just to make sure everything is crystal clear, your subscription will renew every 6 months at the $49.99 rate."
"264","Aur yeh ensure karne ke liye ki sab kuch bilkul clear ho, aapka subscription har 6 mahine mein $49.99 ke rate par renew hoga."
"265","Unless you choose to cancel before the renewal date."
"266","Jab tak aap renewal date se pehle cancel nahi karte."
"267","You'll receive an email reminder about a week before your subscription renews."
"268","Aapko ek email reminder milega, subscription renew hone se ek hafte pehle."
"269","So you won't be caught off guard again."
"270","Isliye aap phir se surprise nahi honge."
"271","Does that sound like it will work for you?"
"272","Kya yeh aapke liye kaam karega?"
"273","I realize it can be quite frustrating when you've been told different things each time."
"274","Mujhe samajh aata hai ki yeh kaafi frustrating ho sakta hai jab aapko har baar kuch alag bataya jata hai."
"275","And I completely understand how it feels like you're being left in the dark."
"276","Aur main bilkul samajhta hoon ki yeh kaise lagta hai jab aapko andhere mein chhoda gaya ho."
"277","What I can tell you is that the storms caused some widespread delays."
"278","Jo main aapko bata sakta hoon woh yeh hai ki toofan ne kaafi badhi der ho gayi thi."
"279","But the good news is your package is now back on track and should arrive tomorrow."
"280","Lekin acchi khabar yeh hai ki aapka package ab sahi raaste par aa gaya hai aur kal tak pahuch jana chahiye."
"281","I can see that it left our shipping facility a few hours ago."
"282","Mujhe yeh dikhai de raha hai ki yeh kuch ghante pehle humari shipping facility se nikal gaya tha."
"283","Sure, let me explain that to you."
"284","Haan, main aapko yeh samjhaata hoon."
"285","You can earn points by using your credit card for purchases."
"286","Aap apne credit card ka istemal karke kharidari karne par points kama sakte hain."
"287","And the number of points you earn will depend on the type of purchase and the amount you spend."
"288","Aur jitne points aap kamayenge, woh kharidari ke type aur aapke kharch par depend karenge."
"289","You can redeem your points for a variety of rewards such as cashback, statement credits, or travel rewards."
"290","Aap apne points ko kai tarah ke rewards ke liye redeem kar sakte hain, jaise cashback, statement credits, ya travel rewards."
"291","You can view a full list of rewards and their point values on our website."
"292","Aap hamari website par rewards aur unke point values ki poori list dekh sakte hain."
"293","Once we receive the necessary documentation, it typically takes about five to seven business days for the new dependent to be added to the plan."
"294","Jab humein zaroori documentation mil jata hai, toh aam taur par naye dependent ko plan mein add karne mein 5 se 7 kaam ke din lagte hain."
"295","In the meantime, you can add your new dependent to your insurance card by calling our customer service line and requesting a temporary ID number."
"296","Is dauran, aap apne naye dependent ko apne insurance card mein add kar sakte hain, hamari customer service line par call karke aur temporary ID number maang kar."
"297","This can be used to obtain medical care until the permanent ID card is issued."
"298","Is temporary ID ko medical care lene ke liye istemal kiya ja sakta hai jab tak permanent ID card issue nahi ho jata."
"299","I completely understand your hesitation."
"300","Main bilkul samajh sakta hoon aapki jhijhak."
"301","To make things even more flexible for you, I'll ensure that you can cancel at any time during the next 3 months without any additional charges."
"302","Aapke liye cheezein aur flexible banane ke liye, main ensure karunga ki aap agle 3 mahine mein kabhi bhi cancel kar sakein bina kisi additional charges ke."
"303","This way, you can enjoy the discounted rate, still get to watch all of your favorite shows and movies."
"304","Is tarah, aap discount rate ka faayda utha sakte hain, aur apne favorite shows aur movies dekh sakte hain."
"305","And if you still find it challenging, you're free to cancel whenever you need to."
"306","Aur agar aapko ab bhi mushkil lagta hai, toh aap jab chahein cancel kar sakte hain."
"307","I completely understand how you feel."
"308","Main bilkul samajh sakta hoon aap jo feel kar rahe hain."
"309","It can be easy to overlook those details."
"310","Yeh details ignore karna asaan ho sakta hai."
"311","Just to clarify, during the signup process, we did outline that after the six-month free trial, the service would automatically renew at $49.99 for another 6-month period."
"312","Bas clear karne ke liye, signup process ke dauraan humne yeh bataya tha ki 6 mahine ke free trial ke baad, service automatically $49.99 mein renew ho jayegi agle 6 mahine ke liye."
"313","I know sometimes the fine print can be hard to catch, especially when you're eager to try out something new."
"314","Mujhe pata hai ki kabhi-kabhi fine print samajhna mushkil hota hai, khaas kar jab aap kuch naya try karne ke liye excited hote hain."
"315","To apply for a policy loan, you need to provide us with some basic information such as your policy number and the amount you would like to borrow."
"316","Policy loan ke liye apply karne ke liye, aapko humein kuch basic information deni hogi, jaise ki aapka policy number aur kitna paisa aap udhaar lena chahte hain."
"317","We will then review your request, and if approved, we will send you the loan agreement to sign."
"318","Phir hum aapki request ko review karenge, aur agar approve ho gayi, toh hum aapko loan agreement bhejenge sign karne ke liye."
"319","Once the loan is approved, the funds will be dispersed to you in the manner specified in the loan agreement."
"320","Jab loan approve ho jayega, paisa aapko loan agreement mein diye gaye tareeke se diya jayega."
"321","That sounds very frustrating."
"322","Yeh kaafi frustrating lag raha hai."
"323","I'm going to check the notes from your previous call to see what troubleshooting steps have already been taken."
"324","Main aapke pichle call ke notes check karunga/karungi taaki dekh sakoon ki kaunse troubleshooting steps pehle liye gaye hain."
"325","Please hold for a few minutes."
"326","Kripya kuch minute ke liye hold par rahiye."
"327","It looks like you've already gone through the basic troubleshooting steps."
"328","Aisa lagta hai ki aap already basic troubleshooting steps se guzar chuke hain."
"329","Unfortunately, it seems like this might be an issue that requires a technician to come out."
"330","Afsoos ki baat hai, lagta hai ki yeh issue aisa ho sakta hai jisme technician ko aake dekhna padega."
"331","Absolutely Mo'Nique, your plan includes coverage for mental health services including therapy and counseling."
"332","Bilkul Mo'Nique, aapke plan mein mental health services, jaise therapy aur counseling, ke liye coverage shamil hai."
"333","Depending on the specifics of the provider and type of service, you may have a co-payment or co-insurance."
"334","Provider aur service ke type ke hisaab se, ho sakta hai aapko co-payment ya co-insurance dena pade."
"335","I can check your specific benefits if you provide me with the names of any mental health professionals you're considering."
"336","Main aapke specific benefits check kar sakta hoon agar aap mujhe koi bhi mental health professionals ke naam bata dein jinke baare mein aap soch rahe hain."
"337","That's a great question."
"338","Yeh ek accha sawal hai."
"339","While your plan does offer some coverage for emergency medical expenses abroad, it's essential to be aware that coverage may be limited."
"340","Aapke plan mein emergency medical expenses ke liye kuch coverage hai, lekin yeh zaroori hai ki aap jaan lein ki coverage limited ho sakta hai."
"341","I recommend contacting our travel assistant hotline before your trip to get more information and guidance on international coverage."
"342","Main aapko salah deta hoon ki apne trip se pehle hamare travel assistant hotline se sampark karein taaki aapko international coverage par adhik jankari aur margdarshan mil sake."
"343","They'll be able to provide specific details."
"344","Woh aapko specific details de sakte hain."
"345","Congratulations on your new addition."
"346","Aapko naye member ke liye badhai ho."
"347","Adding a dependent to your plan is a simple process."
"348","Apne plan mein dependent add karna ek asaan prakriya hai."
"349","First, you'll need to provide proof of the new dependent's relationship to you, such as a birth certificate or adoption papers."
"350","Sabse pehle, aapko naye dependent ka aap se rishta sabit karne ke liye proof dena hoga, jaise ki birth certificate ya adoption papers."
"351","You can do this by logging into your account on our website and uploading the documents or by mailing them to our office."
"352","Aap yeh hamare website par apne account mein login karke aur documents upload karke ya unhe hamare office ko mail karke kar sakte hain."
"353","All right, I'm looking at your bill and it looks like the standard charge for your plan is still $80."
"354","Theek hai, main aapka bill dekh raha hoon aur lagta hai ki aapke plan ka standard charge abhi bhi $80 hai."
"355","However, I'm seeing a few additional fees this month."
"356","Lekin, main is mahine kuch additional fees dekh raha hoon."
"357","One of them is a late payment fee from last month."
"358","Unmein se ek last month ka late payment fee hai."
"359","And there's also a data overage charge."
"360","Aur ek data overage charge bhi hai."
"361","Have you noticed any recent changes in your usage, like more streaming or data use?"
"362","Kya aapne apni usage mein koi recent changes dekhe hain, jaise zyada streaming ya data use?"
"363","That's an important aspect of mental health care."
"364","Yeh mental health care ka ek zaroori hissa hai."
"365","If you need to consult with a psychiatrist for medication management, it falls under your Behavioral Health Coverage."
"366","Agar aapko medication management ke liye psychiatrist se consult karna hai, toh yeh aapke Behavioral Health Coverage ke andar aata hai."
"367","Keep in mind you may need a referral from your primary care physician."
"368","Yeh yaad rakhein ki aapko apne primary care physician se referral ki zaroorat ho sakti hai."
"369","And any medications prescribed will be subject to your prescription drug benefits."
"370","Aur jo bhi medications prescribe kiye jayenge, woh aapke prescription drug benefits ke andar aayenge."
"371","I understand how you feel, sir."
"372","Main samajh sakta hoon aapko kaisa mehsoos ho raha hai, sir."
"373","Thank you again for your patience."
"374","Aapke patience ke liye phir se dhanyawaad."
"375","I'll send you an email shortly with all the details about the replacement and the return process."
"376","Main aapko jaldi hi ek email bhejunga, jisme replacement aur return process ke sabhi details honge."
"377","If there is anything else you need in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out."
"378","Agar is beech koi aur madad chahiye ho, toh bina jhijak humse sampark karein."
"379","I'll be keeping an eye on the progress so you don't have to follow up."
"380","Main progress par nazar rakhoonga taaki aapko follow-up karne ki zarurat na ho."
"381","I see."
"382","Samajh gaya."
"383","You have the right to appeal any denied claim or coverage decision."
"384","Aapke paas kisi bhi deny ki gayi claim ya coverage decision par appeal karne ka hak hai."
"385","To do so you'll need to submit a written request for appeal along with any supporting documentation such as a letter from your doctor explaining the medical necessity of the procedure."
"386","Iske liye aapko appeal ke liye likhit request deni hogi, saath hi koi supporting documentation, jaise ki aapke doctor ka letter jo procedure ki medical necessity ko explain karta ho."
"387","You can download the appeal form from our website."
"388","Aap hamari website se appeal form download kar sakte hain."
"389","C covers a wide range of medical services including preventative care, doctor's visits, and prescription medications."
"390","C kai tarah ke medical services cover karta hai, jaise ki preventative care, doctor ki visits, aur prescription medications."
"391","It also has low out-of-pocket costs."
"392","Isme out-of-pocket costs bhi kam hain."
"393","The monthly premium is higher than the other plans, but it may be a good choice if you anticipate needing a significant amount of medical care in the future."
"394","Iska monthly premium doosre plans se zyada hai, lekin agar aapko future mein kaafi medical care ki zarurat ho sakti hai, toh yeh acha choice ho sakta hai."
"395","Fantastic! I'm happy we could get everything sorted out."
"396","Fantastic! Main khush hoon ki hum sab kuch theek kar paaye."
"397","Just a quick reminder, your next renewal will be on March 15th next year."
"398","Ek chhoti si yaad dilaane ke liye, aapka agla renewal agle saal 15 March ko hoga."
"399","And you'll receive a reminder before then."
"400","Aur aapko usse pehle reminder mil jayega."
"401","If you have any questions or want to make changes to your subscription at any time, feel free to contact us."
"402","Agar aapko koi sawaal ho ya aap apni subscription mein koi changes karna chahein, toh hamesha humse sampark karein."
"403","We are always here to help."
"404","Hum hamesha madad ke liye yahan hain."
"405","I'm really sorry that didn't resolve the issue."
"406","Mujhe sach mein afsos hai ki isse problem solve nahi hui."
"407","It definitely sounds like you've done everything right on your end."
"408","Yeh bilkul lagta hai ki aapne apni taraf se sab kuch sahi kiya hai."
"409","At this point, it seems like the thermostat may have a hardware issue that we won't be able to fix remotely."
"410","Ab lagta hai ki thermostat mein hardware issue ho sakta hai, jise hum remotely thik nahi kar paayenge."
"411","Let me review your order to check if you're still within the warranty period."
"412","Mujhe aapka order dekhna hoga, taaki dekh saku ki kya aap abhi bhi warranty period ke andar hain."
"413","Thank you Miss Lee."
"414","Shukriya Miss Lee."
"415","Okay, I've processed your request and you are now enrolled in the hardship program."
"416","Theek hai, maine aapka request process kar diya hai aur aap ab hardship program mein shamil ho gaye hain."
"417","Your payment for this month will be waived and you will not be charged any late fees or interests."
"418","Is mahine ka aapka payment maaf kar diya gaya hai aur aapko koi late fees ya interest nahi lagega."
"419","However, it's important to remember that you will still be responsible for paying the full balance."
"420","Lekin, yeh yaad rakhna zaroori hai ki aapko poora balance pay karna hoga."
"421","Now about the data usage since you mentioned that your usage was higher than normal during your trip, this might have been a one-time thing."
"422","Ab data usage ke baare mein, aapne kaha ki aapka usage aapke trip ke dauraan normal se zyada tha, toh yeh ek baar ka issue ho sakta hai."
"423","However, if you think your data needs might increase in the future, I can review our current plans with higher data limits to help you avoid additional charges."
"424","Lekin, agar aapko lagta hai ki aapki data ki zarurat future mein badh sakti hai, toh main humare current plans ko review kar sakta hoon jo zyada data limits ke saath hain, taaki aapko extra charges se bachaya ja sake."
"425","I'm really sorry to hear that sir."
"426","Mujhe yeh sunkar bahut afsos hua sir."
"427","I completely understand how upsetting it is when something important doesn't arrive on time."
"428","Main bilkul samajhta hoon ki jab kuch zaroori cheez time par nahi aati, toh kitna upsetting hota hai."
"429","Let me gather some more details about what's going on with your order so I can help resolve this as quickly as possible."
"430","Main aapke order ke baare mein aur details ikattha karta hoon taaki main is issue ko jaldi se solve kar saku."
"431","Could you let me know your order number please?"
"432","Kya aap mujhe apna order number bata sakte hain?"
"433","Yes Monique, your plan does offer coverage for virtual therapy sessions through Telehealth Services."
"434","Haan Monique, aapka plan virtual therapy sessions ke liye Telehealth Services ke through coverage deta hai."
"435","It's a convenient option, especially in today's digital age."
"436","Yeh ek convenient option hai, khaas kar aaj ke digital age mein."
"437","The same cost-sharing rules apply, but it provides flexibility for accessing Mental Health Care from the comfort of your home."
"438","Wahi cost-sharing rules lagu hote hain, lekin yeh aapko apne ghar ke comfort se mental health care access karne ki flexibility deta hai."
"439","I can only imagine, sir, but your persistence shows you're dedicated to your customer, and that's something not everyone has."
"440","Main sirf imagine kar sakta hoon, lekin aapki persistence dikhati hai ki aap apne customer ke liye dedicated hain, aur yeh har kisi ke paas nahi hota."
"441","I'm confident that once the package arrives tomorrow, you'll be able to smooth things over."
"442","Mujhe yakeen hai ki jab package kal aayega, tab aap sab kuch theek kar paenge."
"443","It's just one last hurdle, and I'll make sure you're supported all the way."
"444","Yeh bas ek aakhri hurdle hai, aur main yeh ensure karunga ki aapko har step pe support mile."
"445","I need this fixed now."
"446","Mujhe yeh abhi fix karna hai."
"447","I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing this issue."
"448","Mujhe sach mein bahut khed hai ki aapko yeh problem ho rahi hai."
"449","And I know how frustrating it must be, especially with the weather being so hot."
"450","Aur mujhe pata hai ki yeh kitna frustrating hoga, khaas kar jab mausam itna garm ho."
"451","Let's see what we can do to resolve this for you as quickly as possible."
"452","Chaliye dekhte hain ki hum aapke liye yeh jaldi se kaise resolve kar sakte hain."
"453","Could I please have your account number or full name?"
"454","Kya aap mujhe apna account number ya pura naam de sakte hain?"
"455","That sounds good."
"456","Yeh accha lagta hai."
"457","Can I enroll in this plan online?"
"458","Kya main is plan mein online enroll kar sakta hoon?"
"459","Yes, you can enroll in a new plan online through our website."

"468","Aapke plan ke saath, aapko preventive care ke liye comprehensive coverage milti hai, jisme vaccinations, screenings, aur annual checkups shamil hain."
"469","These services are generally covered at 100%, meaning you won't have to pay any out-of-pocket costs for them."
"470","Yeh services aam taur par 100% covered hoti hain, iska matlab hai ki aapko inke liye koi bhi out-of-pocket costs nahi deni padti."
"471","We have been experiencing supply chain issues."
"472","Hum supply chain ki dikkat ka samna kar rahe hain."
"473","I apologize for the inconvenience."
"474","Asuvidha ke liye maafi chahta hoon."
"475","Let me put a note on the order."
"476","Mujhe order par ek note lagane do."
"477","Could we text you if there is an update?"
"478","Agar koi update ho, to kya hum aapko message bhej sakte hain?"
"479","We do appreciate your patience."

"501","Our system shows that it's still in transit."
"502","Hamare system ke hisaab se yeh abhi transit mein hai."
"503","I am truly sorry for the delay."
"504","Deri ke liye mujhe sach mein afsos hai."
"505","We are experiencing shipping problems due to the supply chain crisis."
"506","Supply chain ki dikkat ke karan hume shipping mein problem ho rahi hai."
"507","I can make a request to the warehouse to send us an update, then we can call you with the information."
"508","Main warehouse se update bhejne ki request kar sakta hoon, fir hum aapko call karke bataenge."
"509","I am so sorry, Ms. Davis."
"510","Main bahut maafi chahta hoon, Ms. Davis."

"591","It sounds like the thermostat isn't responding to any of the changes you're trying to make."
"592","Aisa lagta hai ki thermostat un changes par respond nahi kar raha jo aap karne ki koshish kar rahe hain."
"593","Let's try a few more troubleshooting steps together."
"594","Chaliye milkar kuch aur troubleshooting steps try karte hain."
"595","Hopefully, we can get it working properly."

"972","Samajh gaya, chaliye is mahine ke bill ka breakdown dhyan se dekhte hain."
"973","So we can figure out what's causing the increase."
"974","Taaki hum samajh sakein ki price increase ka kya reason hai."
"975","I'll review the charges line by line for you."
"976","Main charges ko line by line aapke liye review karunga/karungi."
"977","It'll just take a moment."
"978","Isme bas ek pal lagega."
"979","Thank you, I have verified your information."
"980","Shukriya, maine aapki information verify kar li hai."
"981","And I can confirm that your card has now been activated."
"982","Aur main confirm kar sakta/sakti hoon ki aapka card ab activate ho gaya hai."
"983","You should be able to use it right away."
"984","Aapko ise turant use kar paana chahiye."
"985","Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
"986","Kya aaj aapko koi aur madad chahiye?"
"987","Thank you for that information."
"988","Us information ke liye shukriya."
"989","I see that the claim was denied because the medical procedure in question was classified as elective surgery."
"990","Main dekh raha hoon ki claim ko deny kiya gaya tha kyunki jo medical procedure tha, wo elective surgery ke roop mein classify kiya gaya tha."
"991","Which is not covered under your insurance plan."
"992","Jo aapke insurance plan ke under cover nahi hota."
"993","That is the reason we can offer it to customers at such a great price."
"994","Yeh wajah hai ki hum ise customers ko itni achhi price par offer kar pa rahe hain."
"995","In your case, it would save you approximately $16 per month."
"996","Aapke case mein, yeh aapko lagbhag $16 per month bachayega."
"997","Does this seem like something that might fit your budget?"
"998","Kya yeh aapke budget ke hisaab se fit lagta hai?"
"999","I understand, thank you for providing that information."
"1000","Samajh gaya/gayi, us information ko dene ke liye shukriya."
"1001","For your calling needs, I recommend our Globe Trotter plan."
"1002","Aapki calling needs ke liye, main aapko hamara Globe Trotter plan recommend karta/karti hoon."
"1003","Which includes increased data and international calling minutes to Europe."
"1004","Jisme badhi hui data aur Europe ke liye international calling minutes included hain."
"1005","If you checked the size guide on the order form, it should be fine."
"1006","Agar aapne order form par size guide check kiya hai, toh yeh theek hona chahiye."
"1007","But if you're not sure about the fit, we do offer free returns."
"1008","Lekin agar aapko fit ke baare mein sure nahi hai, toh hum free returns offer karte hain."
"1009","So you can try it on and return it if it doesn't work out."
"1010","Toh aap ise pehn kar dekh sakte hain aur agar yeh kaam nahi aata, toh aap ise wapas kar sakte hain."
"1011","Thank you Mr. Davis, I'll pull up your order details right now."
"1012","Shukriya Mr. Davis, main abhi aapke order details dekhta hoon."
"1013","While I'm doing that, just to confirm, have you already tried resetting the device by holding the power button for 10 seconds?"
"1014","Jab tak main yeh kar raha hoon, bas confirm karna chahta hoon, kya aapne device ko reset karne ki koshish ki thi, power button ko 10 seconds tak daba kar?"
"1015","Yes, I see the error in the shipment."
"1016","Haan, main shipment mein galti dekh raha hoon."
"1017","I'm going to initiate a return for the incorrect item."
"1018","Main galat item ke liye return shuru karunga."
"1019","And schedule a replacement for the model X you originally ordered."
"1020","Aur jo model X aapne originally order kiya tha, uska replacement schedule karunga."
"1021","I do apologize for the error."
"1022","Main galti ke liye maafi chahta hoon."
"1023","You're most welcome."
"1024","Aapka shukriya."
"1025","I'll make sure everything gets taken care of."
"1026","Main ensure karunga ki sab kuch theek se ho jaye."
"1027","And I'll follow up with you as soon as the replacement arrives."
"1028","Aur jaise hi replacement aata hai, main aap se follow up karunga."
"1029","Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?"
"1030","Kya is waqt koi aur madad chahiye aapko?"
"1031","I apologize for the difficulty you have had trying to reach our support team."
"1032","Main maafi chahta hoon ki aapko hamari support team tak pahuchne mein dikkat hui."
"1033","I know how frustrating that can be."
"1034","Mujhe pata hai ki yeh kitna frustrating ho sakta hai."
"1035","May I have your account number so that I can look up your information?"
"1036","Kya main aapka account number le sakta hoon taaki main aapki information dekh sakoon?"
"1037","I'm pulling up your account now."
"1038","Main abhi aapka account dekh raha hoon."
"1039","Okay, I've got it."
"1040","Theek hai, maine dekh liya."
"1041","So you mentioned that your bill is higher than usual."
"1042","Toh aapne kaha tha ki aapka bill usual se zyada hai."
"1043","Do you happen to know how much it typically is and what the current amount says?"
"1044","Kya aapko pata hai ki typically kitna hota hai aur current amount kya batata hai?"
"1045","Thank you for that. Let me pull up your account information."
"1046","Iske liye shukriya. Main aapka account information dekh leta hoon."
"1047","Thank you for your patience. Our system is running a little slow right now."
"1048","Aapke patience ka shukriya. Hamara system thoda slow chal raha hai abhi."
"1049","Here it is. May I have your first and last name?"
"1050","Yeh raha. Kya main aapka first aur last name le sakta hoon?"
"1051","I'll give it a try for a few months."
"1052","Main kuch mahine ke liye isse try karunga."
"1053","Wonderful! I'll apply the discounted rate so you'll get the next month free of charge."
"1054","Shandar! Main discounted rate apply karunga, taaki aapko agla mahina free mile."
"1055","Also, I'm making a note of the flexible cancellation option."
"1056","Aur haan, main flexible cancellation option ka note bhi kar raha hoon."
"1057","I'm really sorry to hear that sir."
"1058","Mujhe yeh sunkar bahut afsos ho raha hai, sir."
"1059","I can only imagine how uncomfortable that must be."
"1060","Main sirf yeh imagine kar sakta hoon ki yeh kitna uncomfortable ho sakta hai."
"1061","Especially with the thermostat stuck on such a high temperature."
"1062","Khaas kar jab thermostat itni high temperature par stuck ho."
"1063","I will certainly do my best."
"1064","Main zaroor apna best dunga."
"1065","No, that won't be necessary."
"1066","Nahi, yeh zaroori nahi hoga."
"1067","I appreciate you confirming that, Miss Thompson."
"1068","Main aapka shukriya ada karta hoon, Miss Thompson, is baat ko confirm karne ke liye."
"1069","I see you signed up for our six-month free trial back in March."
"1070","Mujhe dekha ki aapne March mein humare six-month free trial ke liye sign up kiya tha."
"1071","And the trial period ended a few days ago."
"1072","Aur trial period kuch din pehle khatam ho gaya tha."
"1073","Sir, it looks like there was a delay at the shipping facility."
"1074","Sir, aisa lagta hai ki shipping facility mein kuch delay hua hai."
